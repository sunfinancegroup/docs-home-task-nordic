# Homework task description

Implement small application which will be able to handle payment import CSV files (batches) and incoming API calls (
single payment).

Data to work with can be found in `exampleData/` folder.

Payment import and API request has loan number in description. Consists of 2 letters and 8 numbers, starts with LN.

### Business requirements

#### Payment processing

Validation before creation
   - duplicate entry (paymentReference or refId)
   - negative amount
   - invalid date

Save to the storage

#### Payment assignment

When payment amount equals to matched loan amount to pay
   - Mark loan as paid
   - Mark payment as assigned

When payment amount is greater than matched loan amount to pay
   - Mark loan as paid
   - Mark payment as partially assigned
   - Create refund payment as separate entity called "Payment Order" with all necessary information

When payment amount is less than matched load amount to pay
   - Mark payment as assigned

Track paid amounts on loan

#### Console interface
- Show payments by date `report --date=YYYY-MM-DD`

#### Communication functionality implementation (abstraction layer is enough)
- Payment received: communication sent to email and|or phone if defined
- Loan fully paid: communication sent to email and|or phone if defined
- Failed payments report: support@email.com


_If rest of the task takes too much time, skip this requirement._


### Technical requirements

1. PHP;
2. Data storage could be anything: files, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.
3. Use only libraries and components that are necessary. No need to use full framework.
4. Two entry points to import payment(-s)
    1. API (single payment)
    2. Console (CSV payment batch)
5. Different error handling
   - API: Duplicate entry - 409, rest of errors - 400, All fine - 2XX depending on implementation
   - CONSOLE: Duplicate entry - 1, Negative amount - 2, Invalid date - 3, All fine - 0
6. Add logging

### Extra points

1. Containerability
2. Scalability
3. Testing
4. Documentation
